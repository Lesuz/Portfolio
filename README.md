# My Portfolio Website

I made a website for myself using React. The website will display my newest projects and some information about me. 

My website can be found at susannahamalainen.com

## Why React?

I decided to use React for my website because I am interested in learning it. I also think I am going to have to learn in at some point to have some career oppurtunities.
